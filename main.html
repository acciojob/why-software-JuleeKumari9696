	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	 <p>
    I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems, creating useful applications, 
    and constantly learning new technologies. The field of software development gives me the opportunity 
    to turn ideas into reality, help people through technology, and build solutions that can make an impact 
    on everyday life. I am motivated by the creativity, growth, and innovation that come with being a developer.
